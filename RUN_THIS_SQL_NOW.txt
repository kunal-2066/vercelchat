🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST RUN THIS SQL FIX NOW
==========================================

Your save is timing out because Row Level Security (RLS) policies are blocking writes.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. Open this link in a new tab:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mtwvhcupvbvvwhjwjtuq/sql/new

2. Copy the ENTIRE contents of DEFINITIVE_FIX.sql

3. Paste into the SQL Editor

4. Click RUN (or press Ctrl+Enter)

5. Wait for "✅ RLS policies have been recreated"

6. Return to your chatbot and try saving settings again

WHY THIS IS NECESSARY:
- You are logged in (user: eab7a0dd-e399-4822-8045-7e1579bd4d76)
- Your session is valid
- BUT the database RLS policies are rejecting your write request
- The request hangs for 8 seconds then times out
- This is a POLICY problem, not a code problem

WHAT THE FIX DOES:
- Drops broken RLS policies
- Creates new working policies that allow authenticated users to write
- Grants proper permissions

AFTER RUNNING THE SQL:
Your save should complete in < 1 second instead of timing out.
